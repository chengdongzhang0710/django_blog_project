# Django Blog Project

This project uses Django, [Medium Editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor), and Bootstrap to build a simple blog 
application.

This blog application can implement:
* User authentication
* Post management (create, update, publish and remove)
* Comment management (create, approve or remove)
